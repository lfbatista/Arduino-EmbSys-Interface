/** NODE SCHEDULE **

0. The node is in hibernation mode
1. The node wakes up at the scheduled time in the day before and starts communicating
   with the Base Station. It sends itÂ´s ID.
2. Awaits for the answer.
3. if error in the connection, tries it back after ... minutes/seconds.

4. Receives th information from the Base Station: time, activation time, pin
   and duration.
5. Clock syncronization.
6. Hybernates.
7. Awakes at scheduled once again and activates the pin for the actuator. The action
   lasts as long as defined from the Base Station.
8. Hybernates.

... On the next day the routine repeats.
